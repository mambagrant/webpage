We live in a world, where computers can automatically recognize people on camera in real time. Artificial intelligence can drive cars or predict complex statistical problems. But to co-align hundreds of crystals, you need several students working for several months. We will fully automatize the co-alignment process by using a state-of-the-art X-Ray Laue diffractometer, robotized manipulators, real-time camera recognition and AI for software analysis. The device (ALSA – Automatic Laue Sample Aligner) will be a true game changer in the field of inelastic neutron scattering, because it will drastically speed-up sample preparation.

The aim of the proposed programmer position is to develop an instrument control software for the ALSA device. ALSA should be able to read and analyse images from several industrial cameras to identify initial crystal positions, grab the crystals using a robotic arm ([Mecademic Meca500](https://www.mecademic.com/en/meca500-robot-arm)) and put them in the X-Ray beam. Afterwards, the scattering image from Laue machine will be evaluated and the crystallographic orientation of the sample will be determined. The last step will be to glue the crystal to an aluminium plate – again using the robotic arm.

It is possible to perform this software development as part of a thesis or software project.
