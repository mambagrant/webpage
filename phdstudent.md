Studying nanostructures by means of neutron scattering is rare because of not sufficient sample mass. Many layered materials with promising application in spintronics, like Van der Waals layered ferrielectric CuInP<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> or quasi-2D-Ising antiferromagnet FePS<sub>3</sub>, is possible to grow only as millimetre sized single crystals. Such size is insufficient for inelastic neutron scattering, which could be employed to study quantum fluctuations, 2D magnetic interactions or magnetoelastic effects (like phonon softening). The only chance of measuring such compounds is to co-align hundreds of tiny crystals, which is technically difficult and time consuming.

Proposed doctoral study is going to tackle this technical limitation by constructing a new robotic device ALSA – automatic Laue sample aligner. By the combination of robotics, artificial intelligence, computer vision and x-ray Laue diffraction, the device will be able to push the limits of what is currently possible to measure with neutrons on the field of spintronic and layered systems.

In addition to the device construction and testing, doctoral student will prepare new promising layered compounds and measure them at neutron facilities.
