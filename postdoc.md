## Who are we?

We are the Magnetism Group at the Department of Condensed Matter Physics of Charles University. Our research topics are for example frustrated magnets, layered van der Waals materials or magnetoelastic hybridization. We have access to a lot of material growth and characterization techniques (such as 20T magnet, laser furnace, SSE and many more) as a part of [MGML](https://mgml.eu/) research infrastructure. This work will be done in the group of [Petr Čermák](https://cermak.science/).

## What’s the project?

The position will be financed from the funded [GAČR JUNIOR STAR](https://gacr.cz/) excellent basic research project [MaMBA](https://mambaproject.cz/). The project aims to show, that magnetoelastic effects are a general property of condensed matter and that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is surpassed far more often than generally thought. Neutrons are an ideal tool for such a task and for that, we will need a neutron scattering expert. You will perform many neutron experiments; you will design proposals and travel around the world and count valuable neutrons scattered from electronic excitations and lattice vibrations.

Some proposed materials do not produce large enough crystals for inelastic neutron scattering studies. It would therefore be necessary to co-align several hundreds of crystals to create a suitable sample. Such alignment processes can take up to several months and require a lot of manpower. We will accomplish this formidable task using the newly constructed state-of-the-art instrument [ALSA](http://mambaproject.cz/alsa) which will automatize the coalignment process using artificial intelligence.

## Your profile?

 - Ph.D. degree (or equivalent) in a relevant area. 
 - Experienced in inelastic (neutron) scattering, lattice vibrations, low dimensional magnetism, and group theory analysis. 
 - Experience with the large-scale infrastructures (TAS and TOF instruments)
 - Knowledge of Python.
 - Ability to work in a team as well as on its own.
 - Ability to work well under pressure in a fast-developing environment.

## What we are offering:

 - **3 years full-time position** with flexible working hours (starting January 2023).
 - Competitive sallary.
 - Work on a long-term project in collaboration with excellent scientists.
 - Modern offices in the center of Prague, Czech Republic — the heart of Europe.
 - Full funding is available to the candidates from all over the world. 
 
 **The deadline for the applications is 30th September.**
